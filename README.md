# As a bored Applied Mathematics student, and a huge football nerd, I have taken it upon myself this summer to attempt to model accurate predictions for the 25/26 English Premier League season's Fantasy Premier League game, using data from the 24/25 season alone.

# For those who are not immersed in the world of fantasy football, this is a game where you can pick your "fantasy" team of 15 real players in the English Premier League based on restrictions such as budgets and team allocations, and are given points based on how the players perform in the real world. This strategic game is highly competitive, with many dedicating hours to plan transfers and tactics to maximize their teams performance. To learn more about FPL, see https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules.

# So what is the purpose of my report, and why bother? Well, frankly, I am not good at FPL. It seems to me the more time I dedicate to fiddling the minute details of my team, the worse my team performs. So, as a 4th Year Mathematics Student at the University of Edinburgh, I thought why not put my skills to use and see if I can use some data analysis, statistical modelling, and coding skills to produce my dream team.

# It is worth noting, the Premier League is highly unpredictable, especially in recent times where teams are closer to one-another in quality than ever before. That is one of the best parts of the English league, and is what makes FPL so fun (and frustrating). So, no matter how accurate my model may end up being, it is worth noting the outcome is likely to be wildly inaccurate compared to the real seasons results, but I will try my best, and I hope you enjoy reading and following my journey throughout this project!

# Best regards,

# Hugh.
